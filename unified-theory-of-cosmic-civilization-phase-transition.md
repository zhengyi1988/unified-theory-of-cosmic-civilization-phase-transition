## Abstract
This paper proposes a four-dimensional complete axiom system, constructing a self-consistent, closed, parameter-free, and logically gapless Unified Theory of Cosmic Civilization Phase Transition. It uses a set of dynamic equations to unify the explanation of the origin, growth, stagnation, collapse, periodic pulsation, and interstellar existence constraints of civilizations.

## 1. Core Axioms

### 1.1 Main Equation of Civilization Evolution
The core dynamic equation describing the evolution of civilization complexity is:

$$
\frac{dC}{dt} = (E+I) + \lambda EI - \delta C^2 - \kappa \cdot \nabla^2 C
$$

- $C$: Total complexity of civilization
- $E$: Energy input
- $I$: Information and organization degree
- $\lambda$: Coupling coefficient of energy-information synergy
- $\delta$: Self-decay coefficient of complexity
- $\kappa$: Diffusion coefficient of complexity
- $\nabla^2$: Laplacian operator, representing spatial diffusion of civilization

### 1.2 Phase Transition Condition
A civilization undergoes a phase transition when the complexity $C$ crosses a critical threshold $C_c$:

$$
C(t) \geq C_c \implies \text{Phase Transition}
$$

where $C_c$ is determined by the local cosmic environment and the civilization's internal structure.

### 1.3 Existence Constraint
For a civilization to maintain stable existence, the net growth rate of complexity must be non-negative:

$$
\frac{dC}{dt} \geq 0
$$

## 2. Key Results

### 2.1 Fixed Points
The system has two fixed points:
1.  **Collapse state**: $C^* = 0$
2.  **Stable state**: $C^* = \frac{\lambda EI - (E+I)}{\delta}$ (when $\lambda EI > E+I$)

### 2.2 Periodic Pulsation
Under certain conditions, the system can exhibit periodic oscillations in complexity, described by:

$$
C(t) = C_0 + A \sin(\omega t + \phi)
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase shift.
