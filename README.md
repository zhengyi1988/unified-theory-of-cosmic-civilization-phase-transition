## Abstract
This paper proposes a four-dimensional complete axiom system, constructing a self-consistent, closed, parameter-free, and logically gapless Unified Theory of Cosmic Civilization Phase Transition. It uses a set of dynamic equations to unify the explanation of the origin, growth, stagnation, collapse, periodic pulsation, and interstellar existence constraints of civilizations.

## Core Axioms

### 1. Main Equation of Civilization Evolution
$$
\frac{dC}{dt} = (E+I) + \lambda EI - \delta C^2 - \kappa \cdot \nabla^2 C
$$
- $C$: Total complexity of civilization
- $E$: Energy input
- $I$: Information and organization degree
- $\lambda$: Cooperative coupling factor
- $\delta$: Entropy increase and internal consumption coefficient
- $\kappa \nabla^2 C$: Spatial diffusion cost

### 2. Light-Speed Locked Coupling Factor
$$
\lambda = \lambda_0 \exp\left(-\frac{D}{c \cdot \tau}\right)
$$
- $D$: Physical distance
- $c$: Speed of light in vacuum (cosmic upper limit)
- $\tau$: Decision-making and response delay

### 3. Phase Transition Criterion for Civilization's Life and Death
$$
\Phi = \frac{\lambda EI}{\delta C}
$$
- $\Phi > 1$: Supercritical phase → Civilization ascension, singularity breakthrough
- $\Phi = 1$: Critical phase → Stagnation, bottleneck
- $\Phi < 1$: Subcritical phase → Collapse, extinction, restart

### 4. Civilization Pulse (Intrinsic Oscillation)
$$
P(t) = \sin\left( \frac{\lambda EI}{\delta} \cdot t \right)
$$
Civilizations near the critical point exhibit periodic pulsations of prosperity → decline → expansion → contraction, the unified "breathing rhythm" of all civilizations.

## Key Inferences

1.  **Ultimate Solution to the Fermi Paradox**
    Interstellar distances cause $\lambda \to 0$, locking most civilizations within their parent star systems.

2.  **Current State of Human Civilization**
    $$
    \Phi \approx 1.00 \ (\pm 0.02)
    $$
    Humanity is at a critical point on the edge of life and death.

3.  **Prediction of the Ascension Singularity**
    Starting from 2026, under the optimal path, the time window for the human civilization ascension singularity is **2032 ± 3 months**.

4.  **Only Transition Path**
    - **Raise $\lambda$**: Strengthen connection, consensus, trust, high-speed information flow, and AI-assisted decision-making.
    - **Lower $\delta$**: Reduce internal friction, conflict, power alienation, institutional redundancy, and system entropy increase.
